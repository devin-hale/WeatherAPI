# Weather API

# 6-8-2023

    Goal with this project: less spaghetti code.  Plan more thoroughly.  Stick to the plan once its made.

    Requirements:
        - Given a city name, pull current weather data from weather API and display it on the screen.
            Details to display:
                Central 'Today' Display
                    Current Temp, Low, High, Condition(with Icon), Precipitation, Humidity, Wind Speed
                Hourly for day
                    Low Temp, High Temp, Precip, and Condition
                7 day Forecast
                    Low Temp, High Temp, Precip, and Condition
                
        - User can search city name.
            Search bar autocompletes, displays compatible results.
    
        - Saves last location
        - Loads last location on start, if it exists
        - Maybe use the user's geolocation to determine the nearest city, and load based off of that as the default?

    Display/Styling:
        - Mobile first.
        - Search bar sits at top.
        - Background changes based on night/day, and weather condition.
            - Maybe make some gifs/MP4's that overlay animations?
        - Everything must transition, and look good.
        - Loading screen while API call happens.

# Logic

    - I'm gonna start with the logic before anything.  Just dealing with data.
    - Weather API module:
        - Realtime Pull
        - Forecast Pull
        - Time Zone Pull
            - It's likely that all three of these will get pulled at the same time.
            - Just takes a city name.
            - Want: Current Temp, Low, High, Condition(with Icon), Precipitation, Humidity, Wind Speed
            - Build them separately, and then later call them individually within a larger 'Load' function

        - Search/Autocomplete Pull
            - Given a search term, return location matches.
            - These can then be passed into a load when clicked on.
